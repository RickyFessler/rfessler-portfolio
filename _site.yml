## To Do:
## Embed image successfully, left aligned from the text
## Finish the "About me" section
## Do research on how a professional portfolio website looks like
## Get the css file to work
## Should I add a place to download my resume? Should I create a page with my resume information on it?
## Do I have any examples of work I can present? (I could probably use that Bread data example)
## With regards to Github, should I be worried about any privacy-related stuff?
## Contact Me (LinkedIn may be enough but I might include my email or if I make a Twitter)
## Testimonials?
